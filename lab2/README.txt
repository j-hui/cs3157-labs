This file should contain:

  - your name
  - your UNI
  - lab assignment number
  - description for each part
  
The description should indicate whether your solution for the part is
working or not.  You may also want to include anything else you would
like to communicate to the grader such as extra functionalities you
implemented or how you tried to fix your non-working code.
